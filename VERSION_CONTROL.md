# Version Control

In the Car Sale App project, we use Git for version control. To ensure a smooth development process, we follow these best practices:

- **Branching**: Developers should create separate branches for new features or bug fixes. Once the work is complete and thoroughly tested, a pull request should be submitted for review.
- **Testing**: All changes must be tested before being merged into the main branch. This ensures that the main branch remains stable and production-ready at all times.
- **Merging**: Changes are merged into the main branch only after they have been reviewed and tested by other team members.
- **Releases**: Periodically, stable versions of the application are tagged as releases. This allows users to access specific versions of the app if needed.
